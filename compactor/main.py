"""Roll many small S3 objects into few large tars, then delete the originals.

The bucket to work on comes from $ARCHIVE_BUCKET; everything else is read from
s3://$ARCHIVE_BUCKET/bucket-archive/config.toml, so one deployment can serve
several buckets with different layouts::

    prefix_pattern = ['@', '.*']     # one regex per level, top down
    suffix_pattern = '\\.eml\\.zst$'   # which objects to bundle

Each discovered prefix is archived into the matching path under
"bucket-archive/". An object's metadata sidecar travels with it into the tar,
and the manifest is written both inside the tar and beside it::

    me@example.com/INBOX/2026/08/06/21-14-20.1786068860.uid-123456.eml.zst
    me@example.com/INBOX/2026/08/06/21-14-20.1786068860.uid-123456.eml.zst.json
    bucket-archive/me@example.com/INBOX/archive-000042.tar
    bucket-archive/me@example.com/INBOX/archive-000042.manifest.jsonl.zst

Once a prefix holds min_archive_mib of matching objects, the oldest are streamed
into the next tar and then deleted, so a source prefix only ever holds what has
not been archived yet. There are no arguments and the Lambda event is ignored.

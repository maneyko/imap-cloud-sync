# compactor

Rolls many small S3 objects into few large tarballs in Glacier Deep Archive,
then deletes the originals.

```bash
ARCHIVE_BUCKET=my-bucket ./main.py     # same code the Lambda runs
```

Nothing in here knows what an email is. It finds prefixes with a list of
regexes, bundles objects whose key matches a suffix, carries along a metadata
sidecar it never interprets, and writes an index. See
[Future plans](#future-plans).

## Why

Deep Archive charges ~$1/TB/month, but adds 40 KB of billable metadata per
object and a request per restore. 400,000 individual objects would drown in
overhead. Packed into ~250 MiB tars, the overhead disappears.

## How it works

1. **Discover.** Walk the bucket one level per entry in `prefix_pattern`,
   matching each path segment. `['@', '.*']` finds `me@example.com/INBOX/`.
   `bucket-archive/` is always skipped, so it can never archive its own output.
2. **Select.** List a source prefix in key order, take objects matching
   `suffix_pattern` until `min_archive_mib` is reached, skipping anything newer
   than `min_age_seconds`.
3. **Bundle.** Stream each object and its `<key><sidecar_suffix>` sidecar into a
   tar via multipart upload, so memory stays at roughly one part regardless of
   size. The manifest goes in as the final member.
4. **Index.** Write the same manifest beside the tar in STANDARD.
5. **Delete.** Remove the sources and their sidecars.

That order matters: a crash before step 5 costs duplicate work, never data.

## Configuration

Defaults live in [`config.toml`](config.toml); each bucket overrides them at
`s3://<bucket>/bucket-archive/config.toml`. The bucket name itself comes from
`$ARCHIVE_BUCKET` — the one setting that cannot live in the bucket.

```toml
prefix_pattern = ['@', '.*']      # one regex per level, top down
suffix_pattern = '\.eml\.zst$'    # which objects to bundle

sidecar_suffix = ".json"          # metadata for "<key>" lives at "<key>.json"

archive_storage_class  = "DEEP_ARCHIVE"
manifest_storage_class = "STANDARD"

min_archive_mib = 250
min_age_seconds = 3600            # never race the process still writing
part_size_mib   = 16
time_reserve_ms = 300_000         # stop starting archives near the Lambda timeout
```

Objects that do not match `suffix_pattern` are ignored entirely — which is how a
`state.json` can sit inside a source prefix and never be bundled or deleted.

## What it produces

```
bucket-archive/me@example.com/INBOX/archive-000001.tar               DEEP_ARCHIVE
bucket-archive/me@example.com/INBOX/archive-000001.manifest.jsonl.zst  STANDARD
```

Archive numbers come from listing the archive prefix — `max(N) + 1` — so there
is no counter to keep in sync. Inside the tar, members are named relative to the
source prefix, each followed by its sidecar, with the manifest last:

```
2026/08/06/21-14-20.1786068860.uid-123456.eml.zst
2026/08/06/21-14-20.1786068860.uid-123456.eml.zst.json
...
archive-000001.manifest.jsonl.zst
```

The manifest is JSONL: a header line, then one line per object with its key,
size, etag and the full parsed sidecar.

```json
{"key":"…uid-123456.eml.zst","name":"2026/08/06/…","size":28019,
 "etag":"…","sidecar_key":"…eml.zst.json",
 "metadata":{"internaldate":"…","subject":"…","from":[…]}}
```

`sidecar_key: null` means no sidecar existed; a `sidecar_key` with
`metadata: null` means one existed but would not parse — the raw bytes are still
in the tar either way.

Searching costs one GET per archive and no Glacier restore:

```bash
aws s3 cp s3://BUCKET/bucket-archive/…/archive-000001.manifest.jsonl.zst - \
  | zstd -dc | jq -c 'select(.metadata.subject | test("invoice"; "i"))'
```

## Running it

The Lambda is scheduled nightly and reads `$ARCHIVE_BUCKET` from its
environment. To run it by hand:

```bash
aws lambda invoke --function-name imap-sync-s3-archiver \
  --cli-read-timeout 0 --payload '{}' /tmp/out.json
```

`--cli-read-timeout 0` is not optional. The CLI's 60-second default silently
retries, producing a second concurrent invocation that races the first.

Each run archives what it can in the time available and stops with
`time_reserve_ms` to spare; it is resumable by design, so a large backlog just
takes several invocations. Loop until it reports `"archives": []`.

```bash
./bin/deploy.sh          # build, upload to S3, update the function
./bin/deploy.sh --build  # build only
```

## Restoring

```bash
aws s3api restore-object --bucket BUCKET --key bucket-archive/…/archive-000001.tar \
  --restore-request Days=7,GlacierJobParameters={Tier=Bulk}   # 12-48h
aws s3 cp s3://BUCKET/bucket-archive/…/archive-000001.tar - | tar -x
```

The tar carries everything needed to interpret itself: every message, every
sidecar, and the manifest. No config, no database, no external index.

## Future plans

**This component is intended to move into its own repository.** It is written
generically on purpose — the next use is photo and video backup, where files
look like `2026/08/12-00-34.567.jpg` with an `exiftool -json` sidecar beside
them. Serving that bucket needs no code change, only its own config:

```toml
prefix_pattern = ['^\d{4}$', '^\d{2}$']
suffix_pattern = '\.(jpe?g|png|mp4|mov)$'
sidecar_suffix = '.json'
```

Keep it that way. The archiver should stay blind to what the data means —
deciding what metadata is worth recording belongs to whichever uploader writes
it. That separation is the only reason one archiver can serve both buckets.

Each bucket wants its own Lambda and IAM policy, since the delete scope is
necessarily specific to the file types being bundled.
